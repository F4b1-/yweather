        Location ID. The Weather Channel uses these to identify locations around the world. Because Yahoo! Weather gets their weather data from The Weather Channel, the Location ID can be used on Yahoo's RSS Feed to gain access to a 5-day weather forecast. Note: this usage is undocumented.

    WOEID
        Where On Earth IDentifier. Yahoo! GeoPlanet uses these 32-bit identifiers to reference spatial entities around the world. See `Yahoo! GeoPlanet's Key Concepts <http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/concepts.html#woeids>`_ for more information.
